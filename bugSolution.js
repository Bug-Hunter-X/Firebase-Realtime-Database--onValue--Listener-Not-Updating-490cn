The issue was resolved by ensuring that the `onValue` listener was correctly attached and detached.  Previously, multiple listeners might have been attached without proper cleanup. The solution involves adding a mechanism to remove the listener when it's no longer needed, preventing multiple registrations and ensuring that the listener updates correctly.  Additionally, carefully handling asynchronous operations with `Promise`s can further prevent unexpected behavior.  Here's an example incorporating these improvements:

```javascript
let listenerRef = null; // Add a variable to store the listener reference

function attachListener() {
  listenerRef = ref.on('value', (snapshot) => {
    const data = snapshot.val();
    // Update UI with data
  });
}

function detachListener() {
  if (listenerRef) {
    ref.off('value', listenerRef); // Correctly remove the listener
    listenerRef = null; // Clear the listener reference
  }
}

// Example usage:
attachListener();
// ... perform operations ...
detachListener();
```
